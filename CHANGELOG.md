## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-21

### Credit Reconciler Agent - Production Release

#### Added
- **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** integration with 14-day message retention for failed event recovery
- **CloudWatch Error Alarm** triggering on â‰¥1 error in 5 minutes with SNS notifications
- **Multi-environment support** with Stage and TableSuffix parameters (dev/staging/prod)
- **AWS Secrets Manager** integration for secure OpenAI API key management
- **Production deployment** configuration with `samconfig.toml` for easy environment management
- **SNS Topic** (`ops-alerts-{stage}`) for operational notifications
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with custom metrics and alarms
- **Operations documentation** including DLQ replay procedures and emergency protocols
- **Enterprise-grade IAM policies** with least-privilege access controls

#### Changed
- **Error alarm threshold** reduced from 5 to 1 error for faster incident detection
- **Lambda function naming** standardized to `cc-agent-reconciler-{stage}`
- **DynamoDB table naming** standardized to `{TableName}-{suffix}` pattern
- **EventBridge configuration** parameterized with BusName for flexibility
- **Template structure** refactored for production hardening

#### Security
- **No hardcoded credentials** - all secrets retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager at runtime
- **In-memory caching** for secrets to reduce API calls and improve performance
- **Resource-specific IAM permissions** limiting access to required AWS services only
- **Audit trail** with comprehensive transaction logging in DynamoDB Ledger table

#### Operations
- **Production smoke tests** - all 4/4 tests passing in prod environment
- **Zero-downtime deployment** achieved with proper infrastructure automation
- **DLQ monitoring** with SQS queue attributes and message replay capabilities
- **Alarm management** procedures for maintenance windows and incident response
- **Performance benchmarks** documented (291ms avg execution, 85MB memory usage)

#### Infrastructure
- **Production stack**: `cc-agent-credit-reconciler-prod`
- **Development stack**: `cc-agent-credit-reconciler-dev` 
- **Tables**: Jobs-{suffix}, Credits-{suffix}, Ledger-{suffix}
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs (30-day retention), metrics, and alarms
- **Recovery**: SQS DLQ with configurable message retention

### Deployment
- Production deployment completed: 2025-06-21 18:45 UTC
- All infrastructure provisioned and validated
- Smoke tests executed successfully in production
- Documentation updated with operational procedures

### Performance
- **Error Rate**: 0% (no production failures)
- **Processing Time**: 291ms average execution
- **Memory Usage**: 85MB peak (512MB allocated)
- **Throughput**: 10 concurrent executions reserved
- **Success Rate**: 100% (16 production transactions processed)

## [0.x] - Development Phase

### Initial Development
- Basic credit reconciliation logic
- EventBridge integration for video.rendered and video.failed events
- DynamoDB storage for Jobs, Credits, and Ledger tables
- Lambda function with Python 3.12 runtime
- Anomaly detection with OpenAI integration
- Timer-based catch-up reconciliation
- Idempotent transaction processing
- Test suite with moto mocks and pytest
