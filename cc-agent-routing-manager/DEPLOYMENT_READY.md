# Routing-Manager Agent - Deployment Ready âœ…

## Status: Ready for Deployment

The Routing-Manager Agent (AGENT-06) is now ready for deployment to the dev environment.

### âœ… Completed Items:

1. **Code Implementation**
   - Rule engine with static routing logic (â‰¤10s & 720p â†’ fal)
   - Idempotent Lambda handler with EventBridge integration
   - SQS message routing to provider queues
   - Heartbeat monitoring every 5 minutes
   - DynamoDB status tracking

2. **Infrastructure**
   - SAM template validated âœ…
   - Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) configured
   - CloudWatch alarms for monitoring
   - IAM permissions properly scoped

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for rule engine
   - Handler tests with mocking
   - Smoke test script ready
   - Sample event files included

4. **Documentation**
   - README.md with deployment instructions
   - EVENT_SCHEMA.md with detailed schemas
   - DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md with step-by-step process
   - SYSTEM_PROMPT.md specification

### ðŸš€ Next Steps (P0):

1. **Deploy to Dev Stage**
   ```bash
   cd meta-agents/cc-agent-routing-manager
   
   # Deploy with actual queue URLs:
   sam deploy --config-env dev \
     --parameter-overrides \
     "Stage=dev" \
     "FalQueueUrl=https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/[ACCOUNT_ID]/FalJobQueue" \
     "ReplicateQueueUrl=https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/[ACCOUNT_ID]/ReplicateJobQueue"
   ```

2. **Run Smoke Tests**
   ```bash
   python scripts/smoke-test.py --stage dev
   ```

3. **Verify Heartbeat**
   - Wait 5 minutes after deployment
   - Check Admin Dashboard for "RoutingManager" with Healthy status

### ðŸ“‹ P1 Items (Post-Deployment):

1. **Enable in SSM Parameter**
   - Add "RoutingManager" to `/contentcraft/agents/enabled`

2. **Monitor Initial Traffic**
   - Watch CloudWatch logs for first routed jobs
   - Verify metrics in VideoJobRouting namespace

3. **Tag Release**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat: Routing-Manager MVP implementation"
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Routing-Manager MVP - Phase 1"
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

### ðŸ“Š Success Criteria:

- [ ] SAM deployment successful
- [ ] Smoke tests pass (routed + rejected events)
- [ ] Heartbeat visible in dashboard
- [ ] First real job successfully routed
- [ ] No DLQ messages

### ðŸ”— Integration Points:

Once deployed and verified:
- **FalInvoker** can start consuming from FalJobQueue
- **Frontend API** can send jobs with `"provider": "auto"`
- **CreditReconciler** will see routing events

### ðŸ“ž Support:

If any deployment issues arise:
1. Check CloudWatch logs: `/aws/lambda/routing-manager-routing-manager`
2. Verify queue URLs are correct
3. Check IAM permissions for cross-service access
4. Review DLQ for failed events
